 <h1>@Brombii Here! Nice of you to READ ME.</h1>
		<p>The main things that keep me going are <strong>Journaling, art and Accessability/Diversity</strong> in tech.</P.

<p>I am working on my Asscociates in Computer Programming as well as doing full time work as a DSP, mainly serving autistic men and women-- they are the ones that got me into coding. I'm p-i-v-o-t-i-n-g from my BA in Sociology (I still love it though)</p> 
looking to collaborate on any projects geared twords accessibility and communication aid software. 
I'm kind of new to this and a bit shy :-I 
but collaboration is key!</p>
